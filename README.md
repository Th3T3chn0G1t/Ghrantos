*I'm making a game here - stand back!*

A little game project using the [C3](http://www.c3-lang.org) programming language and my [Genstone](https://github.com/Th3T3chn0G1t/Genstone) framework.

This *definitely* wont work on your machine given how jank the transpilation is. In the future I plan to do a proper parse of C headers to produce the C3 interface.

## Dependencies
*They're submoduled so you don't need to install them or anything*
